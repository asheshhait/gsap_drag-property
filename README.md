I explored how to create a draggable effect using GSAP's Draggable utility.

A **circular element** can be smoothly dragged around the screen â€” mimicking a glowing light that you can move across an award-themed interface.  
Itâ€™s a creative way to highlight **award winners**, **profile cards**, or add playful interactivity to your layout.

Think of it as a **light turning on and off** as it glides over the content!
